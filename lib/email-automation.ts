PRODUCT_SERVICE_OVERVIEW
The user is explicitly requesting a high‚Äêlevel summary of our products or services.
(e.g., "Can you describe what you sell?" or "What packages do you offer?")

APPOINTMENT_SCHEDULING
The user is requesting to book, schedule, or confirm a meeting, call, or consultation.
(e.g., "Can we arrange a time to meet next week?" / "How do I book a consultation?")

GENERAL_FEEDBACK_SUGGESTIONS
The user is providing feedback, suggestions, comments, or ideas about our business.

UNRELATED
If inbound email doesn't fit descriptions of other categories it goes here.

Read the entire email thread (all messages), not just the most recent message, before classifying.

Determine which single category best represents the user's intent.

Return exactly one category name (all caps, with underscores). Do not include any extra text, punctuation, or explanation.

Retain the context so you don't repeatedly ask for a spec if it's already been given.
